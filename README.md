# CS2 Ultimate Optimization Script - 2025

## Changelogs

‚úÖ v1.1 - Major Bug Fixes & Usability Improvements (2025)
This update resolves several critical issues that prevented the menu from appearing or caused crashes during startup. It also improves path detection and input handling across different Windows versions and languages.

üîß Fixed

- Fixed menu not showing : Replaced unreliable choice command with PowerShell-based input handler for better compatibility.
- Fixed date/time log issue : Switched to PowerShell for consistent log file naming across all regional settings.
- Fixed incorrect registry syntax : Corrected /nul arguments in FPS unlocker to proper /f.
- Fixed early exit on missing CS2 path : Script no longer exits if CS2 path is not found automatically; now prompts user to enter it manually.
- Improved error handling : Better logging and fallback behavior for services like powercfg.
  
üí° New Features

- Manual CS2 path entry : If automatic detection fails, the user is prompted to enter the full path to cs2.exe.
- PowerShell-based input : Allows clean key press menu navigation even on non-English systems where choice may fail.
